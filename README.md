## 📂 File Structure

```bash
.
├── setup.sh               # Main executable automation script
├── .env                   # Configuration file with system parameters
├── README.md              # Project documentation

└── logs/                  # Directory for execution logs

```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

**1. Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VinceBiggz/chromeos-optimizer
cd chromeos-optimizer
```

**2. Make Script Executable**

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

**3. Configure Environment**

Edit the .env file to match your desired setup.

```bash
nano .env
```

**4. Run the Script**

```bash
./setup.sh
```
You will be prompted for sudo where necessary.

## 🔁 Automating Execution

**Option 1: Cron Job (Weekly)**

```bash
crontab -e
```
Add the following line (adjust path accordingly):

```bash
@weekly /home/username/path/to/chromeos-optimizer/setup.sh >> /home/username/path/to/chromeos-optmizer/logs/weekly_run.log 2>&1
```

**Option 2: Systemd Timer (Advanced)**
Recommended for more robust scheduling and logging. See docs/systemd-automation.md for setup.
